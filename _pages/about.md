I am working as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://skb.skku.edu/eng_ice/index.do), 
[Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do) and also affiliated
with [Automation Lab](https://micro.skku.ac.kr/micro/index.do)
under the guidance of Professor [Jae Wook Jeon](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=9z0SfKoAAAAJ&hl=ko).
My research areas of interest are Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Image
Processing,and Surveillance System. I am also passionate about designing
vision-based solutions to challenging problems and deploying them to mobile and 
edge devices.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do)
in 2021, a M.Tech degree in Information Technology Management and a B.Sc degree 
in Computer Science. Before joining AI Research, I worked on developing computer 
vision system for traffic surveillance (vehicle detection & tracking,
traffic flow estimation) and developing mobile applications for industrial usages.
